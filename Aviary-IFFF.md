# Notes on Aviary's use of IIIF

* Specifying the language of a captions annotation page would be helpful. On FVA testimonies, it looks like I can infer the language code from the last underscore-separated segment of the filename. For example "mssa_hvt_2033_p1of3_pl.vtt" is language code pl (Polish).
